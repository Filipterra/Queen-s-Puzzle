Welcome to Queens puzzle solver with rectangular board and every chess piece compatibility. Please use "make" or "make all" command to create version with optimalization and "make clean" to quickly delete created files if needed. Also go and make yourself some tea, watch a film or read a book as worst-case scenarios (lack of solution) can take quite some time (for egzample ~5m for 6x6 board and 2 of each piece).
